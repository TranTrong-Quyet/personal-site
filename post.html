                <b>Write for ourselves unlock the power of honesty</b>
                <br><br>
                When we write for ourselves voluntary, we have nothing to hide, nothing to be approved. Therefor we can
                be completely honest with our own felling, be vulnerable, embrace ours own darkness, etc. When we do the
                things to prove that we are honest consciously, and we want to change, we are actually teaching our
                subconscious minds that we are embrace ourselves and we want to be the real self.
                <br><br>
                As soon as your subconscious mind get the direction, it will tell you exactly what to do to be your true
                self or get what you want, that is most powerful, most appropriate for you, and just for you because
                only you know your self the most. And if you continuously give it the right signal "by focus on the
                positive, the goodness, and embrace your self” your mind will tell you what to do and your highest self
                will shape your life. If you do right what your subconscious does is make the you at the present and the
                real-you become one. There for there is no conflict in the mind.
                <br><br>
                <b>How did I discover this</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Because I looked back to my own story. At the beginning of 2021, as a teenager living in the ages of
                constant distraction, instant gratification, I ruined my life in many ways (social media, videogame,
                living a fake life digitally with all kind of addiction). Back in my mind I was always knowing that I
                had something to change, something more right to do, but my monkey mind was always looking for nonsense
                pleasure and kept me away from doing the thing I wanted to do. My mind was in very conflict at that time
                and the more I had to say excuse to my self or to other the more I hated it.
                <br><br>
                I started to change the direction of the mind, this was a very natural process that was basically follow
                my intuition that told me that “let write your thought down, write your thought down”. Then I got the
                journal that my sister had given me 7 years ago and I’d never used it before. I started to journal and
                now I look back, my life started changing from there.
                <br><br>
                <b>Conclusion</b>
                <br><br>
                Honesty is the source of all goodness. As soon as we can feel our true self, we don’t need to pretend to
                be good, all we need to do is to be ourselves, that is good for everything and everyone. That is true
                goodness.
                Stop lying to others and stop lying to ourselves. If you think that you have to lie to be good, that is
                not true goodness.
